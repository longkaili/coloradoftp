/**
 * Initiates a data connection with user.
 *
 * This class establishes a new connection to user's machine as a result of a PORT command.
 * This class is a part of a control connection and is created on a per user basis.
 *
 * When a user wants a server to establish a data connection with his/her machine, this class
 * is executed by a control connection untill a data connection is established or failed.
 * In the latter case it is a responsibility of this class to send a failed reply to the user
 * (this will also clear the INTERRUPT state of the control connection).
 * Otherwise, if data connection is established, this class must add it to a connection pool
 * and set control connection's reference to the new data connection.
 *
 * This class can establish connection with user only after user gets "150" reply from the
 * control connection and not before. Data port listener and data connection do not have to
 * check for "150" reply, but this class has to.
 *
 * The easiest way to test this condition is:
 * 1. Before producing "150" relpy, a command saves into a user session amount of bytes
 *    the control connection has sent to the user so far (byte marker)
 * 2. This class must wait until byte marker apperas in the session and the control
 *    connection writes beyond it
 * 3. When control connection clears its outgoing buffer the "150" reply is sent to the user
 * NB! This class may or may not remove byte marker from the session later, so it is the
 *     responsibility of a file command to clear the byte marker before initiating a new
 *     data connection to make sure that this class will wait for a proper "150" reply.
