 * Pool of active connections.
 *
 * All connections should be added to connection pools. Connection pools process connections'
 * self-service routines(日常活动). If a connection fails to be processed (e.g. throws an exception),
 * the pool must call connection's destroy method and then removes it from its list.
 *
 * Connection pools are not allowed to process destroyed connections but may add or return them
 * in appropriate methods.
 *
 * This class must be aware of core's POISONED status. When core is poisoned it is the
 * responsibility of a connection pool to poison all connections in it, so they will die
 * soon and server will shut down.
