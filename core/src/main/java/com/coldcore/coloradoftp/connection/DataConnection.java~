/**
 * Data connection.
 *
 * Data connections perform data transfers between users and the server. For example when a user
 * requires to upload a file, a new data connection is created. When all data is transferred, the
 * data connection dies. Server provides channels for data connections to read from or to
 * write data into. Channels are usually mounted to files, and it is the responsibility of
 * data connections to close channels in the end.
 *
 * User may have only one data connection which he/she can abort with the ABOR command.
 *
 * Data connection must send a reply to the user after:
 * 1. User aborts it (ABOR command)
 * 2. Data transfer finished
 * 3. Data transfer failed
 * The reply must comply with the command user submitted to trigger a data transfer. Data
 * connections are not allowed to die without producing a reply.
 *
 * For a data transfer to begin a data connection must know where to read file data from
 * or where to save it to (that is a channel). Also it requires a filename (but not for a
 * directory listing, which is also served by data connections) and a command name to
 * produce the correct reply in the end. The best approach wuld be to keep that information in
 * a user session and let a data connection to decide itself when, how and what to transfer.
 *
 * Data connections may be established in two ways: user connects to the server (PASV) or the
 * server connects to a user (PORT).
 *
 * When a user downloads a file, server can test if the complete file has beed downloaded (because
 * it has a stream from the file). But when a user uploads a file, server has no way to test if
 * the data transfer completed sucessully or if the user disconnected earlier before all the data
 * has been uploaded. As a result, all uploads may be considered as sucessful.
 *
 * Because control connection has a reference to a data connection, the data connection must
 * clear that reference when it is ready to be destroyed.

/**数据连接的作用是提供用户和服务器间的数据传输服务
　  数据连接是通过一个Channel来进行数据的读写的，而Channel是和指定的文件向关联的
   数据连接有两种类型，一种是服务器发起的数据连接,用于向用户传输数据(用户下载文件),另一种是用户发起的数据连接
   用于上传数据到服务器中去
   数据连接在完成数据传输或者是传输出错的情况下都需要向用户发送相应的响应
　  控制连接中是持有数据连接的引用的，所以当数据传输完毕，关闭对应的连接时需要先清空这个引用
