/**
 * User command.
 *
 * This class is executed by a command processor and returns a reply which
 * if then send back to user.
 *
 * In general there should be a separate implementation for every FTP command,
 * so every implementation knows how to handle one (and only one) FTP command.
 * This way commands can be easily replaced later.
 *
 * Control connection can enter an INTERRUPT state. In INTERRUPT state user must
 * wait for a server reply and is not allowed to send anything in but the INTERRUPT
 * commands. As a result, there are two types of FTP commands: one will be processed
 * during the INTERRUPT state and the other will be dropped when a control connection
 * is in that state.
 *
 * Some FTP commands put control connection into the INTERRUPT state which is then
 * cleared when the connection sends a reply. Such reply must refer to a command which
 * is allowed to clear the state or does not have a reference to a command.
 *
 * There is a certain set of commands that must be processed during the INTERRUPT state:
 * ABOR, QUIT and STAT.
 * And usually only one command is allowed to clear that state: ABOR.
 * The rest of FTP commands should not bother with INTERRUPT state.

　/**代表FTP命令的类
　　FTP命令分为两类，一类是可以在控制连接处于INTERRUPT状态下可以执行，一类是不能在在控制连接处于INTERRUPT状态下执行的
  所有具体的FTP命令类都会继承这个类；这个类的对象由command processor负责执行,并返回执行结果
